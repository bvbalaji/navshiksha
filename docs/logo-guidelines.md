Don't:
- Stretch or distort the logo
- Rotate the logo
- Add effects like shadows or glows
- Change the colors outside of approved variations
- Place the logo on busy backgrounds that reduce visibility

## Logo Variations

### Full Color

The standard full-color logo should be used whenever possible.

A white (reversed) version is available for use on dark backgrounds.

## File Formats

The logo is available in the following formats:
